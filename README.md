## UC Berkeley CS61B Project 3
In Project 3 of UC Berkeley's CS 61B Course (Data Structures), students were tasked with creating a pseudorandom world generator that generated different world maps based on the seed. Then, we created a world in which the player could start new or load games, move, and interact with the created world.

This project was developed in collaboration with Wilson Wu, another student in CS61B.
